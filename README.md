# loanapprovalprediction

Granting loans to the customers is the integral part and the core business in the banking sector. In 
financial terms, a loan is defined as lending money between individuals, entities, organizations etc. Loan 
prediction is very useful for both the applicants and banks to predict the assurance of the applicant’s 
ability to repay the loan. Applicants will be liable to repay the principal amount that they borrowed and 
interest on the debt.
Our aim in this project is to build a predictive model that predicts the customer’s eligibility for 
loan approval based on the details provided in the application form, to determine if the applicant will be 
able to repay their loan or not. This helps the banks to automate the loan granting process. Therefore, 
this problem falls under supervised classification, and our model in this project is trained using 
algorithms such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbor classifier.
